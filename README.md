# What is the Mission Data Fabric Accelerator?

The Mission Data Fabric accelerator is an opinionated design and implementation of the industry data mesh concepts applied specifically to the Department of the Defense use cases.  It recognizes the unique circumstances and challenges that DoD experiences and provides an accelerated solution for rapid deployment with options and flexibilty for customization. The design includes the enterprise data hub, which provides data mesh services for data providers and consumers, and the data domains where data ingestion, exploration, analytics, and management services required to produce data products is hosted. 

# About Our Customer - Depeartment of Defense
The DoD Data Strategy supports the National Defense Strategy and Digital Modernization by providing the overarching vision, focus areas, guiding principles, essential capabilities, and goals necessary to transform the Department into a data-centric enterprise. Success cannot be taken for granted…it is the responsibility of all DoD leaders to treat data as a weapon system and manage, secure, and use data for operational effect. 

## Vision 
DoD is a data-centric organization that uses data at speed and scale for operational advantage and increased efficiency.
## Focus Areas
The strategy emphasizes the need to work closely with users in the operational community, particularly the warfighter. 
Initial areas of focus include: 
- Joint All Domain Operations – using data for advantage on the battlefield
- Senior Leader Decision Support – using data to improve DoD management
- Business Analytics – using data to drive informed decisions at all echelons

## 8 Guiding Principles that are foundational to all data efforts in the DoD:
1. Data is a Strategic Asset – DoD data is a high-interest commodity and must be 
leveraged in a way that brings both immediate and lasting military advantage.
2. Collective Data Stewardship – DoD must assign data stewards, data custodians, 
and a set of functional data managers to achieve accountability throughout the 
entire data lifecycle.
3. Data Ethics – DoD must put ethics at the forefront of all thought and actions as it 
relates to how data is collected, used, and stored.
4. Data Collection – DoD must enable electronic collection of data at the point of 
creation and maintain the pedigree of that data at all times.
5. Enterprise-Wide Data Access and Availability – DoD data must be made available 
for use by all authorized individuals and non-person entities through appropriate 
mechanisms.
6. Data for Artificial Intelligence Training – Data sets for A.I. training and 
algorithmic models will increasingly become the DoD’s most valuable digital 
assets and we must create a framework for managing them across the data lifecycle 
that provides protected visibility and responsible brokerage.
7. Data Fit for Purpose – DoD must carefully consider any ethical concerns in data 
collection, sharing, use, rapid data integration as well as minimization of any 
sources of unintended bias.
8. Design for Compliance – DoD must implement IT solutions that provide an 
opportunity to fully automate the information management lifecycle, properly 
secure data, and maintain end-to-end records management.

## 4 Essential Capabilities necessary to enable all goals:
1. Architecture – DoD architecture, enabled by enterprise cloud and other 
technologies, must allow pivoting on data more rapidly than adversaries are able to 
adapt.
2. Standards – DoD employs a family of standards that include not only commonly 
recognized approaches for the management and utilization of data assets, but also 
proven and successful methods for representing and sharing data.
3. Governance – DoD data governance provides the principles, policies, processes, 
frameworks, tools, metrics, and oversight required to effectively manage data at all 
levels, from creation to disposition.
4. Talent and Culture – DoD workforce (Service Members, Civilians, and 
Contractors at every echelon) will be increasingly empowered to work with data, 
make data-informed decisions, create evidence-based policies, and implement 
effectual processes.

## 7 Goals (aka, VAULTIS) we must achieve to become a data-centric DoD:
1. Make Data Visible – Consumers can locate the needed data.
2. Make Data Accessible – Consumers can retrieve the data.
3. Make Data Understandable – Consumers can recognize the content, context, and 
applicability.
4. Make Data Linked – Consumers can exploit data elements through innate 
relationships.
5. Make Data Trustworthy – Consumers can be confident in all aspects of data for 
decision-making.
6. Make Data Interoperable – Consumers have a common representation/
comprehension of data.
7. Make Data Secure – Consumers know that data is protected from unauthorized 
use/manipulation.
